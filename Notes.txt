DONE:
each category only one person can give tokens
will send unique qrLink to frontend where frontend will generate the qrcode to be scanned
on scanning by anyone nothing happens will only show qr code on redirecting to the link
if user scanning is cafeteria person then can be redeemed on scanning and delete from DB

FRONTEND (TO DO):
add lottie for successful redemption of token on clicking a btn only visible to cafeteria ppl
if token is not in db then show oopsie uve used it or something like that

CONFIRMATIONS AWAITED:
need confirmation on limit of tokens on a emailid and can show a msg on generating token that this user has reached limit
